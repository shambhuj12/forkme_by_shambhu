# Demo repository for forking
Hello! This repository is made for trying out forking
and creating pull requests from your fork to this
"upstream" repository. Please follow the instructions
below for your pull request.

## Creating a pull request to this fork
To create a pull request to this fork, follow these
steps.

* Fork this repository
* Clone your fork
    - Verify that you've cloned your fork and not this
      repository by running `git remote -v`; you should see
      the SSH URL to your own repository in the `origin`
      remote.
* Create a new branch from `main`
    - The name of the branch is not important, as long as it's not
      `main`
* Commit a file called `<your_username>.txt`
    - The content can be anything you want, but keep it friendly!
* Push your new branch to your fork
* Go to `https://github.com/<your_username>/forkme/pulls` and create
  a pull request to this repository

If everything has gone according to plans, you should see your pull
request under https://github.com/fork-testing/forkme/pulls
